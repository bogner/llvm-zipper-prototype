This is meant to be a general place to list things that should be done "someday"

* Find all sequences of >2 underscores and eradicate them.
* run clang-tidy on libc++
* future should use <atomic> for synchronization.
* Audit shared_ptr use of <atomic>
* Look at test/std/utilities/meta/meta.trans/meta.trans.other/result_of.pass.cpp; why are the tests duplicated?
* Document the "conditionally-supported" bits of libc++
* Look at basic_string's move assignment operator, re LWG 2063 and POCMA
* libc++ is missing try_emplace
* Put a static_assert in std::allocator to deny const/volatile types (LWG 2447)
