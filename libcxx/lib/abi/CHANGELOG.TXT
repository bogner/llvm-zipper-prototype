ABI Changelog
==============
This changelog contains information about ABI changes in libc++. Specifically
the addition and deletion of symbols from the libc++ dylib.

Each entry should start with the revision number followed by a description of
the change. The entry should contain a summary of the ABI changes made,
including what symbols were added, removed, or changed.

To generate a summary use "sym_diff.py" diffing against the appropriate ABI list.
Afterwards the ABI list should be updated to include the new changes.

New entries should be added directly below the "Version" header.
