* The native/yaml reader/writer interfaces should be changed to return
  an explanatory string if there is an error.  The existing error_code
  abstraction only works for returning low level OS errors.  It does not
  work for describing formatting issues.

* We need to add more attributes to File.  In particular, we need cpu
  and OS information (like target triples).
