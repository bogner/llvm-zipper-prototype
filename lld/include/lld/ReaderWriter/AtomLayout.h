/// Construction of AtomLayouts is usually a multi-pass process. When an atom
/// is appended to a section, we don't know the starting address of the
/// section. Thus, we have no choice but to store the offset from the
/// beginning of the section as AtomLayout values. After all sections starting
/// address are fixed, AtomLayout is revisited to get the offsets updated by
/// adding the starting addresses of the section.
