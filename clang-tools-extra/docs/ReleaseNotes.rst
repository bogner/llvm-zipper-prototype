Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- New :doc:`abseil-duration-division
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-duration-division>` check.

  Checks for uses of ``absl::Duration`` division that is done in a
  floating-point context, and recommends the use of a function that
  returns a floating-point value.

- New :doc:`abseil-faster-strsplit-delimiter
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-faster-strsplit-delimiter>` check.

  Finds instances of ``absl::StrSplit()`` or ``absl::MaxSplits()`` where the
  delimiter is a single character string literal and replaces with a character.

- New :doc:`abseil-no-internal-dependencies
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-no-internal-dependencies>` check.

  Gives a warning if code using Abseil depends on internal details.

- New :doc:`abseil-no-namespace
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-no-namespace>` check.

  Ensures code does not open ``namespace absl`` as that violates Abseil's
  compatibility guidelines.

- New :doc:`abseil-redundant-strcat-calls
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-redundant-strcat-calls>` check.

  Suggests removal of unnecessary calls to ``absl::StrCat`` when the result is
  being passed to another ``absl::StrCat`` or ``absl::StrAppend``.

- New :doc:`abseil-str-cat-append
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-str-cat-append>` check.

  Flags uses of ``absl::StrCat()`` to append to a ``std::string``. Suggests
  ``absl::StrAppend()`` should be used instead.

- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-macro-usage
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-macro-usage>` check.

  Finds macro usage that is considered problematic because better language
  constructs exist for the task.

- New :doc:`misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes>` check.

  Finds classes that not only contain the data (non-static member variables),
  but also have logic (non-static member functions), and diagnoses all member
  variables that have any other scope other than ``private``.

- New :doc:`modernize-concat-nested-namespaces
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-concat-nested-namespaces>` check.

  Checks for uses of nested namespaces in the form of
  ``namespace a { namespace b { ... }}`` and offers change to
  syntax introduced in C++17 standard: ``namespace a::b { ... }``.

- New :doc:`modernize-deprecated-ios-base-aliases
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-deprecated-ios-base-aliases>` check.

  Detects usage of the deprecated member types of ``std::ios_base`` and replaces
  those that have a non-deprecated equivalent.

- New :doc:`readability-magic-numbers
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-magic-numbers>` check.

  Detects usage of magic numbers, numbers that are used as literals instead of
  introduced via constants or symbols.

- New :doc:`readability-uppercase-literal-suffix
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-uppercase-literal-suffix>` check.

  Detects when the integral literal or floating point literal has non-uppercase
  suffix, and suggests to make the suffix uppercase. The list of destination
  suffixes can be optionally provided.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl16-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl16-c>` to :doc:`readability-uppercase-literal-suffix
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-uppercase-literal-suffix>`
  added.

- New alias :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-non-private-member-variables-in-classes
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-non-private-member-variables-in-classes>`
  to :doc:`misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes>`
  added.

- New alias :doc:`hicpp-uppercase-literal-suffix
  <clang-tidy/checks/hicpp-uppercase-literal-suffix>` to
  :doc:`readability-uppercase-literal-suffix
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-uppercase-literal-suffix>`
  added.

- The :doc:`readability-redundant-smartptr-get
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-smartptr-get>` check does not warn
  about calls inside macros anymore by default.
