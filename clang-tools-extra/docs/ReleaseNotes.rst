Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- New `android-cloexec-creat
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/android-cloexec-creat.html>`_ check

  Detect usage of ``creat()``.

- New `android-file-open-flag
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/android-file-open-flag.html>`_ check

  Checks if the required file flag ``O_CLOEXEC`` exists in ``open()``,
  ``open64()`` and ``openat()``.

- New `cert-dcl21-cpp
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl21-cpp.html>`_ check

  Checks if the overloaded postfix ``operator++/--`` returns a constant object.

- New `cert-dcl58-cpp
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl58-cpp.html>`_ check

  Finds modification of the ``std`` or ``posix`` namespace.

- Improved `cppcoreguidelines-no-malloc
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-no-malloc.html>`_ check

  Allow custom memory management functions to be considered as well.

- New `misc-forwarding-reference-overload
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/misc-forwarding-reference-overload.html>`_ check

  Finds perfect forwarding constructors that can unintentionally hide copy or move constructors.

- New `misc-lambda-function-name <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/misc-lambda-function-name.html>`_ check

  Finds uses of ``__func__`` or ``__FUNCTION__`` inside lambdas.

- New `modernize-replace-random-shuffle
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-replace-random-shuffle.html>`_ check

  Finds and fixes usage of ``std::random_shuffle`` as the function has been removed from C++17.

- New `modernize-return-braced-init-list
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-return-braced-init-list.html>`_ check

  Finds and replaces explicit calls to the constructor in a return statement by
  a braced initializer list so that the return type is not needlessly repeated.

- Improved `modernize-use-emplace
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-emplace.html>`_ check

  Removes unnecessary ``std::make_pair`` and ``std::make_tuple`` calls in
  push_back calls and turns them into emplace_back. The check now also is able
  to remove user-defined make functions from ``push_back`` calls on containers
  of custom tuple-like types by providing `TupleTypes` and `TupleMakeFunctions`.

- New `modernize-use-noexcept
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-noexcept.html>`_ check

  Replaces dynamic exception specifications with ``noexcept`` or a user defined macro.

- New `performance-inefficient-vector-operation
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/performance-inefficient-vector-operation.html>`_ check

  Finds possible inefficient vector operations in for loops that may cause
  unnecessary memory reallocations.

- Added `NestingThreshold` to `readability-function-size
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-function-size.html>`_ check

  Finds compound statements which create next nesting level after `NestingThreshold` and emits a warning.

- Added `ParameterThreshold` to `readability-function-size
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-function-size.html>`_ check

  Finds functions that have more than `ParameterThreshold` parameters and emits a warning.

- New `readability-misleading-indentation
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-misleading-indentation.html>`_ check

  Finds misleading indentation where braces should be introduced or the code should be reformatted.

- Support clang-formatting of the code around applied fixes (``-format-style``
  command-line option).

- New `hicpp` module

  Adds checks that implement the `High Integrity C++ Coding Standard <http://www.codingstandard.com/section/index/>`_ and other safety
  standards. Many checks are aliased to other modules.
