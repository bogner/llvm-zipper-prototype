What's New in Extra Clang Tools 4.0.0?
======================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed

infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Major New Features
------------------

...

Improvements to clang-query
---------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to clang-rename
----------------------------

- Emacs integration was added.

Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- New `cppcoreguidelines-slicing
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-slicing.html>`_ check

  Flags slicing of member variables or vtable.

- New `cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions.html>`_ check

  Flags classes where some, but not all, special member functions are user-defined.

- New `misc-move-forwarding-reference
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/misc-move-forwarding-reference.html>`_ check

  Warns when ``std::move`` is applied to a forwarding reference instead of
  ``std::forward``.

- `misc-pointer-and-integral-operation` check was removed.

- New `misc-use-after-move
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/misc-use-after-move.html>`_ check

  Warns if an object is used after it has been moved, without an intervening
  reinitialization.

- `modernize-make-unique
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-make-unique.html>`_
  and `modernize-make-shared
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-make-shared.html>`_
  now handle calls to the smart pointer's ``reset()`` method.

- The `modernize-use-auto
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-auto.html>`_ check
  now warns about variable declarations that are initialized with a cast.

- New `modernize-use-equals-delete
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-equals-delete.html>`_ check

  Adds ``= delete`` to unimplemented private special member functions.

- New `mpi-buffer-deref
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/mpi-buffer-deref.html>`_ check

  Flags buffers which are insufficiently dereferenced when passed to an MPI function call.

- New `mpi-type-mismatch
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/mpi-type-mismatch.html>`_ check

  Flags MPI function calls with a buffer type and MPI data type mismatch.

- New `performance-inefficient-string-concatenation
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/performance-inefficient-string-concatenation.html>`_ check

  Warns about the performance overhead arising from concatenating strings using
  the ``operator+``, instead of ``operator+=``.

- `readability-container-size-empty
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-container-size-empty.html>`_ check
  supports arbitrary containers with with suitable ``empty()`` and ``size()``
  methods.

- New `readability-misplaced-array-index
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-misplaced-array-index.html>`_ check

  Warns when there is array index before the [] instead of inside it.

- New `readability-non-const-parameter
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-non-const-parameter.html>`_ check

  Flags function parameters of a pointer type that could be changed to point to
  a constant type instead.

- New `readability-redundant-declaration
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-declaration.html>`_ check

  Finds redundant variable and function declarations.

- New `readability-redundant-member-init
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-member-init.html>`_ check

  Flags member initializations that are unnecessary because the same default
  constructor would be called if they were not present.

- The `readability-redundant-string-cstr
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-string-cstr.html>`_ check
  now warns about redundant calls to data() too.

Fixed bugs:

- `modernize-make-unique
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-make-unique.html>`_
  and `modernize-make-shared
  <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-make-shared.html>`_
  Calling ``make_{unique|shared}`` from within a member function of a type
  with a private or protected constructor would be ill-formed.

Improvements to include-fixer
-----------------------------

- Emacs integration was added.

Improvements to modularize
--------------------------

The improvements are...
