# -file-exec-and-symbols now takes two new (optional) options:

Synopsis

	-file-exec-and-symbols <file> [-p <platform>] [-r <remote-file>]

Specify the executable file to be debugged. This file is the one from which the symbol table is also read. 
When debugging remote targets specify a remote-file for execution and a file from which symbols are read. 
The optional platform is the name of the platform, e.g., "remote-ios" or "ios-simulator". The remote-file 
is the on-device path to the exe.

# -data-info-line

Synopsis

	-data-info-line *<address>
	-data-info-line <file>:<line>

Provides information about a source line. The input can be <address> like 0x12345678 or <file>:<line>
where file is a name of source file and line is the line number. As a result the command returns the following
fields:
    start - address of the first instruction which refers to that source line
    end - address of the last instruction which refers to that source line
    file - the file name
    line - the line number
The last two fields are useful in case you have specified a source line using its address.

Example:
    -data-info-line *0x100000f80
    ^done,start="0x0000000100000f80",end="0x0000000100000f94",file="/Users/IliaK/p/hello.cpp",line="15"

    -data-info-line hello.cpp:15
    ^done,start="0x0000000100000f80",end="0x0000000100000f94",file="/Users/IliaK/p/hello.cpp",line="15"

# =library-loaded notification

The =library-loaded notification has 3 extra fields:
    symbols-loaded - indicates that there are symbols for the loaded library
    symbols-path   - if symbols are exist then it contains a path for symbols of the loaded library
    loaded_addr    - contains an address of the loaded library or "-" if address isn't resolved yet

For example:
    =library-loaded,id="/Users/IliaK/p/hello",target-name="/Users/IliaK/p/hello",host-name="/Users/IliaK/p/hello",symbols-loaded="1",symbols-path="/Users/IliaK/p/hello.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/hello",loaded_addr="-"
    =library-loaded,id="/usr/lib/dyld",target-name="/usr/lib/dyld",host-name="/usr/lib/dyld",symbols-loaded="0",loaded_addr="0x00007fff5fc00000"
