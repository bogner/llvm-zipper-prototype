.Sh DESCRIPTION      \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is the command line interface for the LLDB debugger library. 
.Nm
can debug C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ programs.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h, -help 
Prints out the usage information for the 
.Nm
debugger.
.It Fl v, -version 
Prints out the version number of the 
.Nm 
debugger.
.It Fl a, -arch Ar arch
Specifies which architecture 
.Nm
will use when launching the specified program (assuming the provided
executable is built for multiple architectures.)
.It Fl f, -file Ar filename
Specifies the executable file that
.nm
will be launching / attaching to.
.It Fl n, -attach-name Ar process-name
Specifies the name of a currently-running process to attach to.
(or the name of a process to wait for if \fB\-w\fR is used.)
.It Fl w, -wait-for
When used in concert with \&\fB\-n process-name\-E\fR, indicates that
.Nm
should wait for a new process of that name to be started -- and attach
to it as early in the process-launch as possible.
.It Fl p, -attach-pid Ar pid
Specifies a currently running process that
.Nm
should attach to.
.It Fl l, -script-language Ar language
Tells the debugger to use the specified scripting language for
user-defined scripts, rather than the default.  Valid scripting
languages that can be specified include Python, Perl, Ruby and Tcl.
Currently only the Python extensions have been implemented.
.It Fl d, -debug
Tells the debugger to print out extra information for debugging itself.
.It Fl s, -source Ar filename
Tells 
.Nm
to read in and execute the file "\fBfilename\fR", which
should contain 
.Nm
commands.
.It Fl e, -editor
Instructs
.Nm
to open source files using the host's "external editor" mechanism.
.It Fl x, -no-lldbinit
Do not automatically parse any '.lldbinit' files.
.Pp
(If you don't provide -f then the first argument will be the file to be debugged
so 'lldb -- <filename> [<ARG1> [<ARG2>]]' also works.
Remember to end the options with "--" if any of your arguments have a "-" in them.)

.Sh SEE ALSO
The LLDB project page http://lldb.llvm.org/ has many different resources for
.Nm
users -- the gdb/lldb command equivalence page http://lldb.llvm.org/lldb-gdb.html can
be especially helpful for users coming from gdb.
