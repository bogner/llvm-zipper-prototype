# Enable RTTI on GCC builds because one source file in this directory
# (cxa_demangle.cpp) uses dynamic_cast<> and GCC (at least 4.6 and 4.7)
# complain if we try to compile it with -fno-rtti. This is somewhat of a
# kludge because it forces us to enable RTTI in liblldbUtility.a and also
# link in additional clang static libraries to resolve vtable references,
# but actually has negligible impact on (shard object) file size.
